/**
 * Turns an object whose values are different reducer functions, into a single

 * into a single state object, whose keys correspond to the keys of the passed
 * reducer functions.
 *
 * @param {Object} reducers An object whose values correspond to different
 * reducer functions that need to be combined into one. One handy way to obtain
 * it is to use ES6 `import * as reducers` syntax. The reducers may never return
 * undefined for any action. Instead, they should return their initial state
 * if the state passed to them was undefined, and the current state for any
 * unrecognized action.
 *
 * @returns {Function} A reducer function that invokes every reducer inside the
 * passed object, and builds a state object with the same shape.
