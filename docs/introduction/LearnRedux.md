# Learn Redux

## Just the Basics

If you're brand new to Redux and want to understand the basic concepts, see:

- The **[basic tutorial in the Redux docs](https://redux.js.org/basics)**
- Redux creator Dan Abramov's **free ["Getting Started with Redux" video series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)** on Egghead.io
- Redux co-maintainer Mark Erikson's **["Redux Fundamentals" slideshow](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2018/03/presentation-reactathon-redux-fundamentals/)** and **[list of suggested resources for learning Redux](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/12/blogged-answers-learn-redux/)**
- If you learn best by looking at code and playing with it, check out our list of **[Redux example applications](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples)**, available as separate projects in the Redux repo, and also as interactive online examples on CodeSandbox.
- The **[Redux Tutorials](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/redux-tutorials.md)** section of the **[React/Redux links list](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links)**.  Here's a top list of our recommended tutorials:
    - Dave Ceddia's posts [What Does Redux Do? (and when should you use it?)](https://daveceddia.com/what-does-redux-do/) and [How Redux Works: A Counter-Example](https://daveceddia.com/how-does-redux-work/) are a great intro to the basics of Redux and how to use it with React, as is this post on [React and Redux: An Introduction](http://jakesidsmith.com/blog/post/2017-11-18-redux-and-react-an-introduction/).
    - Valentino Gagliardi's post [React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: Learning Redux in 2018](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/react-redux-tutorial-beginners/) is an excellent extended introduction to many aspects of using Redux.
    - The CSS Tricks article [Leveling Up with React: Redux](https://css-tricks.com/learning-react-redux/) covers the Redux basics well.
    - This [DevGuides: Introduction to Redux](http://devguides.io/redux/) tutorial covers several aspects of Redux, including actions, reducers, usage with React, and middleware.


## Intermediate Concepts

Once you've picked up the basics of working with actions, reducers, and the store, you may have questions about topics like working with asynchronous logic and AJAX requests, connecting a UI framework like React to your Redux store, and setting up an application to use Redux:

- The **["Advanced" docs section](https://redux.js.org/advanced)** covers working with async logic, middleware, routing.
- The Redux docs **["Learning Resources"](https://redux.js.org/introduction/learning-resources)** page points to recommended articles on a variety of Redux-related topics.
- Sophie DeBenedetto's 8-part **[Building a Simple CRUD App with React + Redux](http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/building-a-simple-crud-app-with-react-redux-part-1/)** series shows how to put together a basic CRUD app from scratch.


## Real-World Usage

Going from a TodoMVC app to a real production application can be a big jump, but we've got plenty of resources to help:

- Redux creator Dan Abramov's **[free "Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux" video series](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)** builds on his first video series and covers topics like middleware, routing, and persistence.
- The **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)** answers many common questions about how to use Redux, and the **["Recipes" docs section](https://redux.js.org/recipes)** has information on handling derived data, testing, structuring reducer logic, and reducing boilerplate.
- Redux co-maintainer Mark Erikson's **["Practical Redux" tutorial series](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/practical-redux/)** demonstrates real-world intermediate and advanced techniques for working with React and Redux (also available as **[an interactive course on Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/collection/5687753853370368/5707702298738688)**).
- The **[React/Redux links list](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links)** has categorized articles on working with [reducers and selectors](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/redux-reducers-selectors.md), [managing side effects](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/redux-side-effects.md), [Redux architecture and best practices](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links/blob/master/redux-architecture.md), and more.
- Our community has created thousands of Redux-related libraries, addons, and tools.  The **["Ecosystem" docs page](https://redux.js.org/introduction/ecosystem)** lists our recommendations, and there's a complete listing available in the **[Redux addons catalog](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links)**.
- If you're looking to learn from actual application codebases, the addons catalog also has a list of **[purpose-built examples and real-world applications](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links/blob/master/apps-and-examples.md)**.

Finally, Mark Erikson is teaching a series of **[Redux workshops through Workshop.me](#redux-workshops)**.  Check the [workshop schedule](https://workshop.me/?a=mark) for upcoming dates and locations.

## Courses

There are many courses available both on and offline, free or paid. Take a look at some of the courses below if that's your learning style.

### [Watch the free "Getting Started with Redux" video series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)

> Note: If you enjoyed Dan's course, consider supporting Egghead by [buying a subscription](https://egghead.io/pricing). Subscribers have access to the source code of every example in my videos and tons of advanced lessons on other topics, including JavaScript in depth, React, Angular, and more. Many [Egghead instructors](https://egghead.io/instructors) are also open source library authors, so buying a subscription is a nice way to thank them for the work that they've done.


### Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux

The **[Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)** course is a second free video series by Dan Abramov.  It picks up where the first series left off, and covers practical production ready techniques for building your React and Redux applications: advanced state management, middleware, React Router integration, and other common problems you are likely to encounter while building applications for your clients and customers.  As with the first series, **this course will always be free**.

### Practical Redux course

**[Practical Redux](https://www.educative.io/collection/5687753853370368/5707702298738688/)** is a paid interactive course by Redux co-maintainer [Mark Erikson](https://twitter.com/acemarke).  The course is designed to show how to apply the basic concepts of Redux to building something larger than a TodoMVC application.  It includes real-world topics like:


- Adding Redux to a new Create-React-App project and configuring Hot Module Replacement for faster development
- Controling your UI behavior with Redux
- Using the Redux-ORM library to manage relational data in your Redux store
- Building a master/detail view to display and edit data
- Writing custom advanced Redux reducer logic to solve specific problems
- Optimizing performance of Redux-connected form inputs

And much more!

The course is based on Mark's original free **["Practical Redux" blog tutorial series](http://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/practical-redux/)**, but with updated and improved content.


### Redux Workshops

Redux co-maintainer [Mark Erikson](https://twitter.com/acemarke) has partnered with [Workshop.me](https://workshop.me/) to teach a series of Redux workshops.

The first [**Redux Fundamentals** workshop will be held in New York City, April 19-20](https://workshop.me/2018-04-react-redux?a=mark), and will cover:

- The history and purpose of Redux
- Reducers, actions, and working with a Redux store
- Using Redux with React
- Using and writing Redux middleware
- Working with AJAX calls and other side effects
- Unit testing Redux apps
- Real-world Redux app structure and development

Tickets are still available, and [can be purchased through Workshop.me](https://workshop.me/2018-04-react-redux?a=mark).
