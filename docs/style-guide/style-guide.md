# Redux Style Guide

## Introduction

This is the official style guide for writing Redux code. **It lists our recommended patterns, best practices, and suggested approaches for writing Redux applications.**

Both the Redux core library and most of the Redux documentation are unopinionated. There are many ways to use Redux, and much of the time there is no single "right" way to do things.

However, time and experience have shown that for some topics, certain approaches work better than others. In addition, many developers have asked us to provide official guidance to reduce decision fatigue.

With that in mind, **we've put together this list of recommendations to help you avoid errors, bikeshedding, and anti-patterns**. We also understand that team preferences vary and different projects have different requirements, so no style guide will fit all sizes. **You are encouraged to follow these recommendations, but take the time to evaluate your own situation and decide if they fit your needs**.

Finally, we'd like to thank the Vue documentation authors for writing the [Vue Style Guide page](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/), which was the inspiration for this page.

## Rule Categories

We've divided these rules into three categories:

### Priority A: Essential

These rules help prevent errors, so learn and abide by them at all costs. Exceptions may exist, but should be very rare and only be made by those with expert knowledge of both JavaScript and Redux.

### Priority B: Strongly Recommended

These rules have been found to improve readability and/or developer experience in most projects. Your code will still run if you violate them, but violations should be rare and well-justified.

### Priority C: Recommended

Where multiple, equally good options exist, an arbitrary choice can be made to ensure consistency. In these rules, we describe each acceptable option and suggest a default choice. That means you can feel free to make a different choice in your own codebase, as long as you're consistent and have a good reason. Please do have a good reason though!

By adapting to the community standard, you will:

1. train your brain to more easily parse most of the community code you encounter
2. be able to copy and paste most community code examples without modification
3. often find new hires are already accustomed to your preferred coding style, at least in regards to Redux
