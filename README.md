Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. In essence Redux stores your state as an object tree,
and provides tooling for updating that object and ensuring that all consumers are informed of updates.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).

Redux is often used with [React](https://reactjs.org), however it can be used with any view library.
It is tiny (2kB, including dependencies).

Not to be confused with a WordPress framework – [Redux Framework](https://reduxframework.com/).

## Learn Redux

We have a variety of resources available to help you learn Redux, no matter what your background or learning style is. If you're looking to dive right in check out our [tutorial](introduction/Tutorial.md). We also have quite a few [references available](introduction/LearnRedux.md).

## Help and Discussion

The **[#redux channel](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)** of the **[Reactiflux Discord community](http://www.reactiflux.com)** is our official resource for all questions related to learning and using Redux.  Reactiflux is a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn - come join us!

## Developer Experience

Dan Abramov (author of Redux) wrote Redux while working on his React Europe talk called [“Hot Reloading with Time Travel”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs). His goal was to create a state management library with a minimal API but completely predictable behavior. Redux makes it possible to implement logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay, without any buy-in from the developer.

## Installation

To install the stable version:

```
npm install --save redux
```

This assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.

If you're not, you can [access these files on unpkg](https://unpkg.com/redux/), download them, or point your package manager to them.

We support almost every frontend workflow. If you're using something other than npm this section is [continued here.](InstallationContinued).


### Complementary Packages

To get the full Redux experience get [the developer tools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools). If you're using react you'll probably want [the React bindings](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux).
